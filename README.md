# interaural-timing-difference
My implementation of a wrapper class that allows for interaural timing difference playback precision on Android devices. Uses two byte buffers, one for each audio channel, to continously manipulate slight playback timing differences between the two ears on the order of 0.1 millisecond to mimic the real-world interaural timing difference.

This is a class from a larger library designed for precision audio playback on Android.
